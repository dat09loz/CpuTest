# CPU Test
I wrote this program in Jan 2021, just for fun. Sent this to my friends and compare our runtime.

To run the program, enter in terminal (Windows)

```
java -jar "./dist/CpuTest.jar"
```

This simple program will count from 1 to 1,000,000 and give the total runtime to terminal. The result title says "CPU stress test completed", but it is not stressing the CPU at all.

For reference, my Ryzen 9 5950X on Windows 11 finishes in 36.332+-1 seconds.
